Injuries that gets permanent and causes permanent pain will now get less painful over time. 
Pawns learn to cope with it and will feel less pain as time goes by.



-  After five days pain is reduced to 75%
-  After a quandrum the pain is reduced to 50%
-  After a year the pain is reduced further to 25%



Mod-settings


-  When the three changes occur
-  What pain levels they should give
-  Making pain worse in rain/snow (+100%)
-  Making pain worse in lower than seasonal average temperature (+100%)
-  Making pain worse after waking up (+100% and falling with rest-level)



Safe to add and remove from saves
