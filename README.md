Injuries that gets permanent and causes permanent pain will now get less painful over time. 
Pawns learn to cope with it and will feel less pain as time goes by.



-  After five days pain is reduced to 75%
-  After a quandrum the pain is reduced to 50%
-  After a year the pain is reduced further to 25%
